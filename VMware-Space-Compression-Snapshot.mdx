### Issue 1: Space Compression

When compressing space, ensure that there is enough disk space available. Also, make sure the host machine has enough disk space to write `0` to the disk; otherwise, the write operation may fail. During compression, you may encounter **invalid parameter** issues.

### Issue 2: Snapshot Deletion

Snapshots can occupy a significant amount of disk space. When deleting snapshots, ensure that there is sufficient space available; otherwise, the snapshot deletion may fail.

The problem encountered this time was that the virtual machine's disk was completely filled with `0`, resulting in limited remaining space. Subsequently, attempting to delete the snapshot failed due to insufficient space. When attempting disk compression, an invalid parameter issue occurred.

### Issue 3: Loading Virtual Machine with Incorrect Disk Files

The disk file loaded as the virtual machine's disk is recorded in the `.vmx` file, for example:
> scsi0:0.fileName = "karchlinux.vmdk"

If the disk file is incorrect, you can correct it here. Typically, disk files are `.vmdk` files:
> karchlinux**.vmdk**

请注意，Markdown中的代码块使用三个反引号（```）包裹，并在代码块前后保留空行。标题使用 # 标记（例如 # Issue 1: Space Compression），粗体文本使用 ** 包裹（例如 **invalid parameter**），引用使用 > 符号（例如 > scsi0:0.fileName = "karchlinux.vmdk"）。
